Basic python project 

Task 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

Tasks:
1. Write a program that inputs two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
2. Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. Take the length and width as input from the user.
3. Develop a program that converts a given number of minutes into hours and minutes. For example, 125 minutes should be converted to 2 hours and 5 minutes.

Task 2: Using Comparison Operators

Tasks:
1. Write a program that takes two numbers and checks if they are equal, not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal.
2. Create a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
3. Develop a program that takes three numbers as input and prints the largest and smallest of the three numbers.

Task 3: Combined Arithmetic and Comparison Operations

Tasks:
1. Create a program that takes three side lengths and determines if they can form a triangle. Additionally, check if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
2. Develop a program that simulates a simple banking system. Take an initial balance and a series of transactions (deposits and withdrawals), then print the final balance. Ensure that withdrawals do not exceed the current balance.

Task 4: Arithmetic and Comparison Practice

Tasks:
1. Average Calculator: Write a program that takes three numbers as input and calculates their average. Then, check if the average is greater than a specified threshold.
2. Triangle Type Checker: Develop a program that takes three side lengths and determines if they form a valid triangle. Additionally, check if the triangle is acute, obtuse, or right-angled.
3. Leap Year Checker: Create a program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not.
4. Temperature Converter and Comparator: Write a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit and compares if two temperatures are the same in different units.

Task 5: Mixed Operations

Tasks:
1. Simple Interest Calculator: Write a program that calculates the simple interest given the principal, rate of interest, and time. Then, check if the interest is above a certain amount.
2. Body Fat Percentage Calculator: Create a program that calculates the body fat percentage for a given weight and body fat weight. Then, determine if the person is in a healthy range.
3. Speed Comparison: Develop a program that takes two speeds (in km/h and mph), converts them to the same unit, and checks which one is faster.
4. Quadratic Equation Solver: Write a program that solves a quadratic equation and determines the nature of its roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex)
